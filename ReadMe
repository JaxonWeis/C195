The purpose of this application is to pass class C195 requirements. This application
Takes in customer information and creates appointments that can be view and edited at
any time. All of the customer information and appointment information is stored in a
database that can be edited in the mysql class.

Appointments and Customers. If you have an appointment within 15 minutes of getting this
page the bottom edge of the window will show the next appointment in red with the start
time. On the Appointments tab you can seek for appointments with the left and right buttons
seeking by month or week depending on the selected view. The selected view toggle buttons
can also widen or narrow your view to a week or a month. You can also add update or delete
appointments. Make sure the appointment is selected when updating or deleting. Similar
